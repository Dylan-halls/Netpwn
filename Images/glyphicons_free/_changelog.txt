ban (this "ban" icon was mirrored all the time in both sets, sorry for this bug guys - but funny thing is, that my "competitor", who copied in his first version all Halflings, still have this icon also mirrored as I created this icon in 2010. The lesson: you should never copy anything blindly :)

glyph-paperclip			-> paperclip (in Halflings set, only change of CSS class)
glyph-pushpin			-> pushpin (in Halflings set, only change of CSS class)

(To explain changes above: it may seems crazy to rename such an amount of icons, but I had to sync these names between Basic and Halflings set - my apology, I should have done this long time before. On top of that, I've found a better way how to optimize certain icon names for older browsers inside the font file itself, so these tweaks with names are no longer necessary)
